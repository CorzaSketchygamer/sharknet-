<h1>Shark Net</h1> 

<p>A Shark net is a submerged net placed around beachs to reduce shark attacks on swimmers. The majority of Shark nets used are Gillnets which is a wall of netting that hangs in the water and captures the targeted sharks by entanglement.</p>

<p>Shark nets do not offer complete protection but work on the principle of "fewer sharks, fewer attacks". They reduce occurrence via sharks mortality. Sharks nets such as those in New South Wales are designed to entangle and kill sharks and other animals that pass near them.</p>

<p>Over 15,000 animals have been killed by there nets in NSW - this includes about 100 species such as endanged turtles,  dolphines, gugongs, rays, seabirds, harmless sharks  and rays. They have even killed orcas, little penguins and people. Sharks need have killed  2 people.</p>

<p>The NSW Sharkmeshing prgoramme is estimated to cost about $1.4 million per year, for a 8 month contract that operates on 14 days of the month on beache between Wollongong and Newcastle.</p>
